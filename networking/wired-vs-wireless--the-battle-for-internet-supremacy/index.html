				<h2>The Future of Connectivity: Why Wireless Internet Will Coexist with Wired Technology</h2>
			</header>

			<section>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>It is projected that in the near future, wireless internet will replace wired internet... but not completely. Hereâ€™s why.</p>
				<h2>Reasons for the Rise of Wireless Internet</h2>
				<p>Wireless internet will become as ubiquitous as water, electricity, or the network pluses (subscription services) and as abundant as mosquitos in a hot, humid summer ðŸ˜‚. The reasons are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Price: Wireless internet requires less investment and infrastructure, including for large businesses and industrial applications.</li>
					<li>Speed: With the introduction of 5G, we are already seeing speeds nearly as fast as typical CAT5e (not CAT5) wired connections. 5G can reach up to 10 Gbps, and speeds are expected to increase to 1 Tbps with the still-experimental 6G.</li>
					<li>Practicality: In my neighborhood, someone stole the ISP's internet fiber and copper lines, leaving a large area of over 50 blocks without internet for about three weeks. As a result, the company had to pay workers overtime, along with the costs of materials and repairs to restore the wired internet service. With wireless, ISPs only need to invest in wireless towers (currently 5G) and, as a result, avoid the need for new wires, installation, or the security risks of theft. After speaking with the head of my ISP in charge of Southern California Area, he said, "We prefer our customers to move to 5G. It's cheaper for the company, gives them fast internet with a 5G wireless home router, and prevents our infrastructure from being stolen, like what happened in your area".</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>The Enduring Advantage of Wired Internet</h2>
				<p>However, historically, wired internet has been and will always offer the fastest internet speed in town. It is the "Fast and Furious" of internet - the Godzilla of Kaiju's. While wireless internet technology will keep advancing, wired technology will also evolve in tandem and continue to outpace wireless, maintaining its speed advantage over wireless.</p>
				<h2>The Future Landscape of Internet Connectivity</h2>
				<p>In certain areas, such as homes, commercial businesses, and ISPs, replacing wired internet with wireless makes sense. It is projected that 6G will be released around 2030 - just six years from now. If it truly delivers 1 Tbps speeds, home internet and businesses may increasingly prefer wireless, and ISPs could move away from offering wired services. Or offer wired services to specific customers at a cost, just as is the case now with static IPs.</p>
				<p>Yet, we are hastily moving towards a fully connected and networked world. Technologies like Cloud Computing and AI are accelerating this change even faster. In industries and businesses where the demand for the fastest and most reliable internet is crucial, wireless will never replace wired; wireless internet simply can never compete. Even intercontinental communications across the pond, via undersea cables, will never be replaced by wireless anytime soon. It is projected that AI alone could require speeds of up to 100 Tbps in a few years.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In summary, while wireless internet will replace wired in some areas, wired internet will remain the "sleeping Godzilla" in the background. Wired internet is, and will forever continue to be, the true king of internet speed.</p>
