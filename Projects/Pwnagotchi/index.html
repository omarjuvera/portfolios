<p>Are you looking for a cool project?<br />
Do you need an activity to put in your portfolio?<br />
Are you bored and wanna have some fun?</p>

<p>We&#39;ll, I&#39;ve got you covered!<br />
<strong>Meet: Pwnagotchi<br />
Don&#39;t pay for internet, ever again lol</strong>&nbsp;😂🤣</p>

<p>Pwnagotchi is like Pokemon and Tomogachi combined into one, but for us Hackers!<br />
As you&#39;ve already may have noticed, I have been advocating for ya&#39;ll to get a Raspberry Pi for most of your hacking projects/portfolio. With the cost of only $15 who can blame me?</p>

<p>This super compact mini &quot;computer&quot; &nbsp;has the power to do most of your hacking projects. It also has the <strong>form factor</strong> for <s>James Bond</s> Q spy hacking action! Just tuck it in a hidden corner and done!</p>

<p>This project has a price any student can afford. The price, oh baby! The price! <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/YZLc4-DYwB8?si=9kK5vVsiTck2-OWp"><img src="https://c.tenor.com/COcSmM3DDf0AAAAC/tenor.gif" alt="He he, boy!"><br />He he, boy!<br />https://youtube.com/shorts/YZLc4-DYwB8?si=9kK5vVsiTck2-OWp</a></p>

<p>Then is the SD system. You can store different projects in each SD and just swap SD&#39;s instead of your wallet.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough shameless promotion. Now onto the details of the <strong>Pwnagotchi</strong><br />
This is a Wi-Fi hacking tool What sets this project apart from the Wi-Fi Pineapple, in my opinion are two things:<br />
Fun factor<br />
AI</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not care much about the fun factor, to walk around town. Or wardriving to feed your <strong>Pwnagotchi</strong> and keep it happy. But you will surely care about the AI function.</p>

<p>You see, both points 1 and 2 are connected because the more you &quot;feed&quot; your Pwnagotchi friend with Wi-Fi locations, to keep it happy, the better it gets at hacking through AI learning.</p>

<p>That is right, this little project is powered by AI and can get really good at cracking some password protected Wi-FI signals. Gotta-catch-em-all!</p>

<p>So how do you make one?<br />
